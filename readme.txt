Core web vitals booster for Nestify.io. This plugin will optimize pagespeed of your sites hosted on Nestify.

== Description ==
**This plugin only supports WordPress sites hosted on https://nestify.io. You can signup for a free trial subscription at https://nestify.io**

Speedien optmizes your site for best performance on desktop and mobile devices automatically. No coding required. We start by prioritizing resources needed for above-the-fold content and deferring everything else. This helps improve core web vitals metrics automatically and help with search engine rankings.

This plugin enables a high speed global CDN that automatically optimizes site's static assets, images, and videos. CDN also converts images to WebP format to reduce the file size. Images are automatically resized according to visitor's screen size. 

This core web vitals booster plugin is used to link your speedien.com account and WordPress. After the plugin is installed and activated, your site's contents are automatically optimized on our cloud servers. These optimized content are then served by WordPress from the cache, which minimizes the response time or TTFB.

This plugin also optimizes your site for marketing campaigns as well as paid traffic or CPC. Usually email marketing campaigns and Facebook or Google Ads add unique query parameters to each visitor's request. This causes typical cache plugins to bypass cache, making them ineffective in real-world usage. With Speedien, all marketing tags, ad click IDs are automatically ignored and your visitors receive instant response from cache.

This plugin intelligently excludes visitors from cache when they are making any WooCommerce transactions. If you update your site, blog posts, or pages from wp-admin, these pages are automatically removed from the cache and preloaded again with fresh content.

Speedien service includes 24x7 support with 1 hour response time or less. If you run into any issues or need help optimizing your site further, our web performance experts are ready to assist. We also monitor core web vitals of your website each day and send you a report. If your site's score changes by more than 10 points, it automatically starts a review process on our end. 

Using this plugin along with a Speedien.com subscription helps you stay on top of your site's performance and improve conversions as well as SEO rankings.
